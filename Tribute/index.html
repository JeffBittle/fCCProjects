        <p>The Cynical Brit is just one of the self-ascribed monikers of the British-born man known as John Bain, but online he became better known as TotalBiscuit.  He transitioned from hosting a metal-themed radio show while at university in England, to hosting a World of Warcraft fan radio show for many years.</p>
        <p>Those events prepared him for his next transition to a new and rapidly growing industry, that of creating content on Youtube.  Although he started with a focus on World of Warcraft and its newest expansion content at the time, he soon branched out into more general video game content.</p>
        <p>He especially got a reputation for giving a spotlight to promising up-and-coming independent developed games, and some notoriety for warning viewers of his content away from games which were buggy, outright broken and likely not worth anyone's time.</p>
        <p>He was a man with very strong opinions of games and the gaming industry as a whole.  This made him a polarizing figure, but also an effective critic.  He never shied away from calling out any companies in the gaming industry for dodgy, anti-consumer practices or shoddy efforts, especially when it came to PC offerings or ports of console games to the PC.</p>
        <p>John Bain unfortunately lost his several year long battle with cancer in May of 2018 at only 33 years old.  He was taken far too young, but his effects on the gaming industry will be remembered.</p>
